🧩 About the Term “Requiring Support”

In official diagnostic language, Autism Level 1 is described as “requiring support.” But that doesn’t always mean needing therapy or assistance from others.

If you relate to some traits described in this test, it might simply mean:
- You thrive with routines and structure  
- You prefer clear, logical conversations  
- You might feel more comfortable online than in spontaneous social settings  
- You sometimes struggle with small talk, sudden changes, or sensory overload

These experiences don’t make you “less capable” — just different in how you process the world.

Support can mean simple tools like:
- Choosing calm environments  
- Having personal rituals  
- Planning ahead for change  
- Learning to self-advocate

This test is not a diagnosis — it’s a reflection tool to help you better understand yourself.
