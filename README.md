    ⚠️ Disclaimer

This test is not a diagnostic tool. It is a personal reflection aid inspired by the AQ-28 and RAADS-R assessments to help users identify potential traits associated with Asperger Syndrome (Autism Level 1). It does not evaluate more severe forms of autism (Levels 2 or 3), nor should it replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you or someone you know is experiencing significant difficulties or symptoms, consult a qualified specialist or explore resources like Autism Speaks.
